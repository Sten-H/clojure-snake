# Snake

A snake-clone with time rewind done in clojurescript to learn clojure and clojurescript a bit more. Just doing this to familiarize myself with how
clojure works!

Thanks to noobtuts for getting me started! http://noobtuts.com/clojure/2d-snake-game.

## Usage

Arrow keys to steer, space to reset, hold left control key to rewind time..
